# Skin Lesion Classifier App (Flutter)

This is a Flutter mobile application designed to help users identify whether a skin lesion is **benign** or **malignant**. The app allows users to upload or capture an image of a skin lesion, which is then analyzed by a machine learning model running on a Django backend 

## Features

- üì∏ Capture an image with the camera or select from the gallery  
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Upload the image to a Django backend  
- üß† Receive classification results (Benign or Malignant) 
- üóÇ View previous results 

## Backend

The app connects to a Django backend that handles:

- Image processing and model inference
- Classification using a ResNet-50 model trained on the **HAM10000** dataset

> üí° The model is trained to distinguish between benign and malignant skin lesions.
